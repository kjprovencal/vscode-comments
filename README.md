# kyle-keybindings README

Simple vscode extension for conditionally commenting blocks or lines of code. 
Start a comment using `cmd+/`. 
If multiple lines are selected, a block comment will be created using `editor.action.blockComment`. 
If 1 or fewer lines are selected, a line comment is created using `editor.action.lineComment`.
